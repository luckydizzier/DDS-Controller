# DDSDriver Implementation

`DDSDriver` is a lightweight wrapper intended for controlling the AD9850 DDS
module. The current implementation is only a stub that exposes three methods:

- `begin()` – placeholder for hardware initialisation.
- `setFrequency(uint32_t freq)` – expected to program the DDS with the given
  frequency in Hertz.
- `setWaveform(uint8_t type)` – select the output waveform.

The driver is used by both `MenuSystem` and `CommandParser`. Implementation
work is tracked in the root agent remediation log
`2025-06-18_16-55_root_agent_remediation.md`. Future revisions should implement
the 40‑bit serial control sequence required by the AD9850.
