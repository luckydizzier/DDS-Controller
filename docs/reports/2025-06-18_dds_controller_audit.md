# DDS-Controller Full Audit â€“ 2025-06-18

## Summary
This audit reviews repository consistency, progress logging and outstanding tasks. The project mostly follows the file-driven agent model described in `AGENTS.md`, but several directories lack documentation and some milestones are outdated.

## Findings
| Area | Issue | Agent(s) | Suggested Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AGENTS & Milestones | `MILESTONES.md` still lists Windows packaging and Web UI without progress logs | root_agent | Update or close obsolete milestones |
| TODO list | Test tasks and structure sync remain open without clear progress | root_agent, pc_agent, firmware_agent | Mark completed items and dispatch remaining tests |
| Documentation | Firmware, ESP and PC directories lack README files | docs_agent | Add brief READMEs per directory |
| Progress Logs | Logs exist but some tasks have no explicit log link (e.g. Windows packaging) | timeline_agent | Ensure every TODO item has corresponding log |
| Testing | GUI tests fail due to blocked Go module downloads | pc_agent | Add offline stubs or mark tests skipped in CI |

## Notes
- Coverage report shows ~30% unit test coverage; GUI tests blocked by network restrictions.
- `incomplete_implementations.md` still references pending test entries.
- Many `mocks/` headers contain minimal stubs which should be documented.
