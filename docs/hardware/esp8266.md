# ESP8266-01 Wiring Notes

The ESP8266-01 module is integrated as a WiFi bridge for the DDS-Controller. It must be powered by **3.3V** only. Refer to the table in `pinmap.md` for default Arduino Due connections.

```
          +-----------+
  TX_PIN -| TX     VCC|- 3.3V supply
  RX_PIN -| RX     CH_PD|- pulled high (10k)
 GPIO0_LED-| GPIO0  RST|- reset (to Due or RC)
 GPIO2_CMD-| GPIO2  GND|- GND
          +-----------+
```

- **GPIO2_CMD** (GPIO2) is wired to an available Due pin (default 24). It allows the ESP to signal or send commands.
- **GPIO0_LED** (GPIO0) controls a WiFi status LED whenever OTA updates are enabled. Otherwise this pin remains un-driven so the Arduino Due can repurpose it.
- UART pins start from Due pin **20** upward to avoid conflicts with the LCD shield.

Use level shifting if any connection might expose the ESP8266-01 to 5V. See the in-code comments in `firmware/esp/main.cpp` for further notes.
