# ddsctl Implementation

`ddsctl.py` is a command line helper for sending ASCII commands over a serial
port. The script now includes subâ€‘commands for setting and reading the
frequency, as well as saving and loading presets.

The tool is described in `docs/design/pc_ui_mockups.md` and shares the command
set with the GUI. It opens the serial port using `pyserial`, sends the chosen
command, waits for one line of response and prints it.
