# commands.h

`firmware/shared/commands.h` is meant to hold shared command string constants for
both the Arduino firmware and the ESP/PC tools. At the moment it contains only a
placeholder comment. Command definitions should match the ASCII protocol
specified in `docs/dev_protocols/command_spec.md` once the implementation is
expanded.
