# Integration Validation Report â€“ 2025-06-18 17:10

## Summary
- Executed CLI and firmware unit tests verifying short command protocol (`SF`, `GF`, `SW`, `GW`).
- GUI tests could not fetch Go modules due to blocked network access.
- Legacy long-form commands are no longer supported; firmware returns `ERR:INVALID_COMMAND`.
- Updated design documentation and command specification to reflect new short commands.
- Coverage report refreshed with status of tests and noted GUI test issue.

## Recommendations
- Update `protocol/ascii/validator.py` and example code to use short commands.
- Consider vendoring Go modules to allow GUI tests in CI.
