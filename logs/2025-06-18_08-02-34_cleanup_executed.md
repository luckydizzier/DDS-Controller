# Cleanup Execution Log
Date: 2025-06-18 08:02:34 CEST

The following items from the file audit were removed:
- Legacy firmware files at repository root (`AD9850Driver.*`, `ConfigStore.*`, `DisplayManager.*`, `DDS_Controller.ino`)
- Documentation placeholder `firmware/due/mocks/README.md`
- Web UI asset `firmware/esp/web_ui/index.html`
- `.gitkeep` placeholders in `docs/prompts/*` and `pc/gui/Views/`
- Duplicate roadmap `docs/project_roadmap.md`
- Obsolete protocol folder `protocol/rest/`
- Test helper doc `pc/test_tools/README.md`

`ButtonManager.*` files were kept as they are still required for compilation.
