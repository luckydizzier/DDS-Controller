# CI Fyne Module Fix â€“ 2025-06-18 10:59 CEST

- Added missing checksum for `fyne.io/fyne/v2` v2.4.3 in `tests/gui/go.sum`.
- Updated workflow step name to **Pre-download Go modules** to ensure modules are downloaded before tests.
- Attempted `go get` and `go mod tidy`, but downloads failed due to restricted network access in the test environment.
