# Milestone v0.4.0 Summary

## Overview
Milestone **v0.4.0** introduced WiFi connectivity through the ESP8266-01 module. Command relay and OTA updates were added alongside a unified configuration strategy and extensive documentation. A pin configuration file (`config/pins.conf`) now centralises all hardware assignments and both CLI and GUI utilities read the same settings. Shared GPIO control logic was moved out of agent-specific modules, allowing the firmware and ESP layer to share definitions.

Compatibility notes emphasise that all peripherals must be 3.3 V tolerant and that pins below D20 remain reserved for the LCD shield.

## Dispatched Prompts and Logs
The milestone kickoff generated prompts for every agent under `docs/prompts/*/2025-06-18_17-43-41_v0.4.0_plan.md`. Execution logs are stored in `docs/progress/` with timestamps as shown above.

## Known Gaps or Postponed Features
- Full ESP8266 firmware with UART bridge and OTA handler remains in progress.
- Protocol validation tests are pending from `test_coverage_agent`.
- PC tool integration for ESP status monitoring is partially stubbed.

Milestone v0.4.0 established the hardware foundation and documentation for wireless control, paving the way for complete WiFi-based operation in the next release.
