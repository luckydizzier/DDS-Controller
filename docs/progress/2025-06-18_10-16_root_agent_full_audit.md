# Full Project Audit – 2025-06-18 10:16 CEST

## Checklist Results

1. **Project Structure & Layout** – ⚠️
   - Structure mostly follows `project_structure.md`, but extra directories (`dev_tools/`, `tests/`, `logs/`) are undocumented.
   - Some placeholder files (e.g. `firmware/due/main.ino`) remain.

2. **Source Code Health** – ⚠️
   - Firmware modules (`DDSDriver`, `MenuSystem`, `EEPROMManager`, `CommandParser`) implement core logic but lack full validation and error handling.
   - `firmware/esp/main.ino` and `shared/commands.h` are minimal stubs.
   - PC GUI and CLI are functional prototypes.

3. **Documentation Status** – ⚠️
   - Implementation docs exist for most modules under `docs/impl/`.
   - `README.md` is in Hungarian, violating the English‑only documentation rule.
   - Version history in `docs/versions/` has only the initial entry.

4. **Testing Coverage** – ⚠️
   - Unit tests cover firmware, CLI and GUI (approx. 30% according to `coverage_report.md`).
   - No tests for ESP firmware or protocol validators.

5. **Tooling & DevOps** – ✅
   - Makefile defines test targets and `.github/workflows/test-all.yml` runs them.
   - CI warns about missing network access for Go/Python dependencies.

6. **Progress Logging & Milestone Consistency** – ⚠️
   - Progress logs in `docs/progress/` are frequent and timestamped.
   - `TODO.md` still lists tasks already completed (e.g. ESP bridge skeleton, firmware implementations).
   - `MILESTONES.md` lacks updates beyond basic stubs.

7. **Agent Readiness** – ✅
   - `AGENTS.md` and `docs/AGENTS.md` describe roles consistently.
   - Prompt templates exist under `docs/prompts/`, though only storage_agent has a detailed task file.

## Recommendations

- Document `dev_tools/`, `tests/`, and `logs/` in `project_structure.md` or remove if obsolete.
- Replace Hungarian content in `README.md` with an English version per style guide.
- Update `TODO.md` and `MILESTONES.md` to reflect completed firmware and ESP tasks.
- Extend version history under `docs/versions/` for recent milestones.
- Expand tests to cover ESP firmware and protocol validators.
