## Summary
This log records the actions taken by `root_agent` to close out the remaining recommendations from the 2025‑06‑18 audit.

### Milestones
- Marked **EEPROM preset handling** milestone as complete.
- Confirmed **ESP protocol implementation** is still open and linked to existing progress log.

### TODO Updates
- Marked docs agent style guide task as **DONE** with reference to remediation log.
- Added new tasks for GUI test stubs, mock documentation and overall coverage planning.

### Documentation
- Verified that `firmware/`, `pc/` and `firmware/esp/` each contain a `README.md`.

### Testing
- Executed `make test_all`; firmware and CLI tests pass. GUI tests fall back to stub mode due to blocked network access.
