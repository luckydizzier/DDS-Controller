### Prompt Body
Review and implement OTA and configuration support for the ESP8266-01.
- Add `ota_upload`, `show_config`, and `edit_config` commands to the CLI.
- Extend the Qt GUI (`MainWindow.go`) with buttons for OTA upload and viewing the current configuration.
- Ensure the CLI and GUI read the unified `config/pins.conf` file.
- Use stubs or fallbacks so tests pass without hardware.
- Update unit tests for the new commands.
- Document progress in `docs/progress/` and update `TODO.md` accordingly.
