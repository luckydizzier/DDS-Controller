# Root Agent Final Sync â€“ 2025-06-18 17:07 CEST

Performed final repository audit and synchronized tasks:
- Reviewed `TODO.md`, `MILESTONES.md` and all progress logs.
- Verified no stray TODO comments exist in source files.
- Noted missing progress logs for dispatched tasks to `esp_agent`, `docs_agent` (mocks README) and `test_coverage_agent`.
- Dispatched final status check prompts to `timeline_agent`, `docs_agent`, `task_agent`, `pc_agent`, `firmware_agent` and `esp_agent`.
- Generated summary report `docs/reports/final_audit_sync.md`.

All agents are expected to acknowledge completion in their own progress logs.
