# Final Audit Sync – 2025-06-18

This report summarizes the final synchronization review of the DDS-Controller repository.

## Milestones
- **ESP protocol implementation** remains **DISPATCHED** with no follow‑up log from `esp_agent`.
- All other milestones are closed and referenced by progress logs.

## TODO Review
- No stray TODO comments were found in the codebase.
- `TODO.md` lists two dispatched tasks (`docs_agent` mocks README and `test_coverage_agent` coverage audit) without completion logs.
- Additional final status check tasks were dispatched to all active agents.

## Progress Logs
- 41 progress logs are present under `docs/progress/`.
- Missing logs were noted for `esp_agent`, `docs_agent` (mocks README) and `test_coverage_agent` despite dispatches.
- All other logs are referenced from `TODO.md` or `MILESTONES.md`.

## Orphaned Files and Stubs
- No `.tmp` or placeholder files remain after the previous cleanup (see `logs/2025-06-18_08-02-34_cleanup_executed.md`).
- Example utilities in `dev_tools/` and mock headers under `firmware/due/mocks/` are intentionally retained.

## Agent Dispatch Summary
- `timeline_agent`, `docs_agent`, `task_agent`, `pc_agent`, `firmware_agent` and `esp_agent` received final sync prompts to confirm completion.
