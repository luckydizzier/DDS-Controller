# Root Sync Tasks â€“ 2025-06-18 16:57 CEST

## Summary
This synchronization check verified that all `TODO.md` entries marked **DONE** correspond to an existing log in `docs/progress/` and that no `IN_PROGRESS` items remain. Two tasks are still **DISPATCHED** awaiting agent execution.

The only open milestone is **ESP protocol implementation**. It was dispatched but has no progress log yet. A reminder will be sent to `esp_agent` to continue.

## Actions
- Confirmed progress logs for 14 completed tasks.
- No updates were required in `TODO.md` statuses.
- Prepared a follow-up prompt for `esp_agent` to handle the ESP protocol milestone.
