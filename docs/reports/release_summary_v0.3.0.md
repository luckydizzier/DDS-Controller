# Release Summary v0.3.0

## Overview
DDS-Controller integrates local and remote control of an AD9850-based synthesizer using an Arduino Due, ESP8266 bridge and optional PC tools. Documentation now covers firmware, CLI, GUI and protocol design.

## Feature Summary
- **Firmware**: `DDSDriver`, `MenuSystem`, `EEPROMManager` and `CommandParser` are implemented with basic unit tests.
- **CLI**: `ddsctl.py` supports setting/reading frequency and managing presets.
- **GUI**: Fyne-based `MainWindow.go` allows serial control with stubbed tests for CI.
- **Docs**: Full design notes and implementation guides under `docs/`.

## Architecture Overview
System structure follows `docs/design/architecture_overview.md` with three layers: device (Arduino Due + peripherals), protocol (ASCII and optional REST), and PC tools (CLI/GUI). The project layout matches `docs/design/project_structure.md`.

## Known Gaps or Limitations
- ESP8266 firmware and REST API remain in progress.
- GUI tests rely on stub modules due to restricted network access.
- Coverage audit for less-tested modules is pending (`test_coverage_agent`).

## Agent Completion Status
All agents responded to final sync except `esp_agent` and `docs_agent` (mocks README). Timeline and test coverage agents were dispatched for final confirmations. No active coding tasks remain for firmware or PC agents.

## Suggested Version & Tagging Notes
Current milestone coverage suggests tagging this state as **v0.3.0**. Future work on ESP features could trigger v0.4.0. Repository can enter **maintenance** mode while waiting for ESP and documentation updates.
