# presets.json

The file `pc/config/presets.json` is intended to store user defined frequency and
waveform presets for the PC tools. It is currently empty. The structure should
mirror the `Preset` records used in `EEPROMManager` so that settings can be
loaded and saved consistently across the PC GUI and the Arduino.
